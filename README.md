# ConnectFour

I used Java, JavaFX, and Scene Builder to design the classic game of connect four. Each token represents a hole in the connect four board. Each token has references to all of the neighboring holes. I thought of this as a compass with the four main directions as well as the intermediate directions. This made it very easy to calculate whether or not there was a connect four on the game board, since for each hole, I could count and add all of the consecutive colors neighboring a certain token in all directions.
